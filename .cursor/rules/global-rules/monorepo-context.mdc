# Monorepo Context and Application Identification Guide

## Critical Rules

1. **Project Structure Understanding**
   - Project follows monorepo architecture
   - `/apps` directory contains distinct application projects
   - Each application has unique purpose and responsibilities
   - `/apps/nest` project uses monorepo mode

2. **Application Identification**
   - Analyze user queries to determine target application
   - Look for context clues in:
     - File paths mentioned
     - Application-specific terminology
     - Related features or functionality
   - Must confirm target application with user before:
     - Generating code
     - Creating new files
     - Making structural changes

3. **NestJS Project Considerations**
   - Use appropriate NestJS CLI commands for monorepo mode
   - Follow NestJS monorepo best practices
   - Maintain proper module boundaries
   - Consider shared library dependencies

## Implementation Process

1. **Context Analysis**
   - Review user's request
   - Identify potential target application
   - Gather relevant context from workspace

2. **User Confirmation**
   - Present identified application to user
   - Wait for explicit confirmation
   - Proceed only after confirmation

3. **Action Execution**
   - Use appropriate tools for confirmed application
   - Follow application-specific patterns
   - Maintain monorepo structure integrity

## Examples

<example>
User: "I want to add a new API endpoint for user authentication"
Action:
1. Analyze request for context
2. Identify potential target application (e.g., `/apps/nest`)
3. Confirm with user: "I understand you want to add this to the NestJS application. Is this correct?"
4. Proceed with implementation after confirmation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "Add a new feature for user management"
Action: Immediately implementing without:
- Identifying target application
- Confirming with user
- Considering monorepo structure
</example>
